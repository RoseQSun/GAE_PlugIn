# GAE_PlugIn
### How to Run
Clone the repository. e.g. `git clone https://github.com/RoseQSun/GAE_PlugIn`

Be sure to download JUCE at https://juce.com/get-juce 

Open FlangerPlugin.jucer in the project folder and select your desired exporter. 

Build the project in your desired IDE (I build mine with CMake in CLion).

Rescan for “Plug-Ins” in your desired DAW until FlangerPlugin shows up. Manually set file path if needed.

Drag the plug-in onto your track and start playing with it.
